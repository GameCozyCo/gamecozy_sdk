                <p>The GameCozy device lets players turn their drink into a gaming controller, allowing game developers to incorporate its controls, data, and feedback into the gaming experience.</p>
                <p>Gamers can use the GameCozy to interact with games in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Motion capture</li>
                  <li>Angle and direction</li>
                  <li>Proximity detection</li>
                  <li>Vibrational feedback</li>
                  <li>Visual feedback using LEDs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The GameCozy web application is a NodeJS platform app that allows users to play WebGL
                games using the GameCozy device (connected via Web-Bluetooth).</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2 id="about_sdk">About GameCozy SDK</h2>
                <p>The GameCozy SDK was developed to allow game developers to bring their own games and ideas to the GameCozy platform via a simple and easy-to-use interface. The interface allows the game developer to incorporate GameCozy controls, data, and feedback into their games, allowing for an even more immersive and entertaining gaming experience.</p>

                <h3 id="sdk_layout">SDK Layout</h3>
                <p>The GameCozy SDK consists of a Header, Left Rail, Gaming Area, and Right Rail.</p>
                <img src="./images/full_screen.png" style="height: 400px;">
                <h4>Header</h4>
                <img src="./images/header.png" style="width:1000px;">
                <p>At the right end of the
                  <strong>Header</strong>, you will notice a
                  <strong>Host Indicator</strong>,
                  <strong>Play Button</strong>, and
                  <strong>Nickname Indicator</strong>.</p>
                <p>The
                  <strong>Host Indicator
                  </strong>is used to display which player is considered the “Host” of the game and which players are the “Guests” of the game.</p>
                  <img src="./images/guest_header.png" style="width:1000px;">          
                  <p>In the GameCozy SDK, the “Host” will have the ability to Play and Reset the game. Resetting the game will reset the game window for all connected players. (see<strong>
                    <a href="#player_communication">Player Communication</a></strong>)</p>
                    <img src="./images/host_reset.png" style="width:400px;">
                    <p>The “Host” can also be utilized as the controller of the data of record for multiplayer games. (see
                  <strong><a href="#player_communication">Player Communication</a></strong>)</p>
                <p>The
                  <strong>Nickname Indicator</strong>
                  helps identify different players and can be used for keeping track of scores and data for multiplayer games (see
                  <strong><a href="#player_communication">Player Communication</a></strong>).&nbsp; In the GameCozy application, players are able to choose their own Nickname, but in the GameCozy SDK the Nickname is a randomly generated ID that gets updated on every page refresh.</p>
                <h4>Left Rail</h4>

                  </strong>loads the game found at game/game.html (see
                  <strong><a href="#sdk_file_structure">SDK File Structure</a></strong>). If multiple players are connected to the server, the same game will load in sync for all connected players (see
                  <strong><a href="#player_communication">Player Communication</a></strong>). The “Host” may reset the game for all players (and reload the code) by clicking the
                  <strong>Reset
                  </strong>button.</p>

                <p>Additionally,
                  <strong>app.js</strong>
                  is the node app that facilitates the SDK. This is a simplified version of the main GameCozy application that is used to facilitate the starting, ending, and resetting of games as well as communication of game data between players within the SDK.</p>
                <p>Only the functions needed for the facilitation of these functions are included in
                  <strong>app.js</strong>, and<strong></strong>it

                <h2 id="game_structure">Game Structure</h2>
                <p>A basic game template has been created under the
                  <strong>game</strong>
                  directory. GameCozy supports basic WebGL HTML / JavaScript games, including games created through such game development frameworks as Phaser and Unity.</p>
                <p>The game template has been designed to make the porting of games to the GameCozy platform simple and fun. The template contains the following files and folders:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  <strong>assets

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  <strong>game.html</strong>
                  – This is the main html page for your game. Make sure to include both GameCozyFunc.js and game.js, as well as any additional files you might add.</p>

                  <strong>game.js</strong>
                  – This is the main JavaScript file for your game.</p>
                <p>The game needs to be wrapped in an async function that awaits initSCGame() to facilitate the starting of the game between multiple players (see
                  <strong><a href="#game_functions">Game Functions</a></strong>). Without this, the game will not start for single or multiplayer games.</p>

                <h2 id="player_communication">Player Communication</h2>
                <p>The GameCozy SDK was designed to allow for quick communication between multiple players in a game. Every browser window connected to the application will be considered a different “player” in the game. The first player to join is considered the “Host” and the remaining players are considered “Guests”. The “Host” is able to Start and Reset the game for all players (see
                  <strong><a href="#sdk_layout">SDK Layout</a></strong>). If the “Host” is disconnected from the application, the next oldest player will become the “Host”.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Player Communication is facilitated through the SendPlayerData() function that allows the game developer to send a JSON object that will be broadcast to all the players in the game. This could include such information as score or coordinates of objects in the game.</p>
                <p>When game data is received by a player, it will be stored as a hash object in the
                  <em>window.gameData</em>
                  variable. Data from the current player will be stored under a “me” key in the hash, while data from other players will be stored under a key that corresponds to the user’s nickname (see
                  <strong><a href="#sdk_layout">SDK Layout</a></strong>). Additionally, the player’s nickname will be sent as an additional key in the data hash that can be displayed in the game and also used for the MVP Awards screen at the end of a game (see
                  <strong><a href="#mvp_awards">MVP Awards</a></strong>).</p>
                <p>For example, the
                  <em>window.gameData</em>
                  variable in the demo game for the “Host” might look something like this at a moment in time -&nbsp;</p>
                  <img src="./images/host_data.png">
                  <p>While data for the “Guest” in the same demo game might look something like this -&nbsp;</p>
                  <img src="./images/guest_data.png">
                  <p>It is up to the game developer to decide what information to send and how to process that information. (see

                  for more information)</p>
                <p>Either player may call the
                  <em>finishGCGame</em>() function to end the game and show both players the

                <h2 id="demo">Demo Walkthrough</h2>
                <p>The demo game included in the SDK is a basic two-player Pong game adapted from
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/straker/81b59eecf70da93af396f963596dfdc5">

                  </a>. It was created to demonstrate the GameCozy game flow and various GameCozy functions that can be included in a game.</p>
                  <p>To see the demo game in action, swap the <strong>demo</strong> directory with the <strong>game</strong> directory. (see <strong><a href="#sdk_file_structure">SDK File Structure</a></strong>)</p>
                  <p>The game is initiated by calling await
                  <em>initGCGame()
                  </em>inside an async function.</p>
                <p>The “Host” controls the bottom paddle with the GameCozy and the “Guest” controls the top paddle in the same manner. Once the
                  <em>GetMove()</em>
                  function is called, the
                  <em>coords</em>
                  variable is accessed to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>If the “Host” presses the GameCozy button, a new yellow distraction ball will be added to the gaming area. Once the
                  <em>GetMove()
                  </em>function is called, the
                  <em>btnPress</em>
                  variable is accessed to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>If the “Host” taps the GameCozy, the ball speed of the main ball will increase. The
                  <em>GetTap()</em>
                  function is called and the
                  <em>taps</em>
                  variable is accessed to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>If the “Host” takes a sip from the GameCozy, the distraction balls and main ball speed will be reset. Once the
                  <em>GetMove()
                  </em>function is called, the
                  <em>sips</em>
                  variable is used to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>The “Host” utilizes the SendPlayerData() function to update the “Guest” on the location of the main ball, bottom paddle, extra balls, and score. The “Guest” utilizes the SendPlayerData() function to update the “Host” on the location of the top paddle and player’s score.</p>
                <p>The window.checkGameData() function created within the game checks the
                  <em>window.gameData
                  </em>variable, looks for the key of the other player, and updates the game view and data accordingly.</p>
                <p>The demo game is finished when either player calls the

                <p>After reading through the documentation, reference the following as a summary for what to include in a game. Make sure that, minimally, the following elements are in place for basic game functionality.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure the game is wrapped in an async function awaiting initSCGame(). (see
                    <strong><a href="#game_functions">Game Functions</a></strong>)</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure GetMove() is called to begin getting coordinate data / movement from the GameCozy. (see
                    <strong><a href="#game_functions">Game Functions</a></strong>)</li>
                  <li>Utilize the sendPlayerData() function to communicate between players and keep track of scores. (see
                    <strong><a href="#player_communication">Player Communication</a></strong>)</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure GameConfig.json `RankBy` is populated with a data key that is being sent in sendPlayerData() and stored in
                    <em>window.gameData
                    </em>for proper end of game scoring and ranking. (see
                    <strong><a href="#game_configuration">Game Configuration</a></strong>)</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensure finishGCGame() is called when the game is finished and indicate whether the player calling the function is winner or loser. (see
                    <strong><a href="#game_functions">Game Functions</a></strong>)</li>
                </ul>
